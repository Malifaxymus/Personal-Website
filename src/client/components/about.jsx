    <StyledAbout>
      I am a fullstack software engineer/web developer with experience in JavaScript, and specifically the MERN technology stack. I am looking for any opportunity to grow and become a more experienced programmer. I have extensive experience working with groups of engineers, and working autonomously in a solo environment.

      Outside of programming, I like to play guitar, write music, play video games, and spend time with my friends. If you have any openings or you are looking for the perfect person to fit in your team feel free to contact with any of the methods in my contact information section or email me at maxymus.ross@gmail.com. Further information regarding my Software Engineering projects can be found on my GitHub Profile.
